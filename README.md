# Weather Application
A weather application that allows a user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. 
Deployed App - 

## Description
When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 

When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they can see the city name, date, icon representation of the weather, temperature, humidity and wind speed. 

When a user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city. 

Through the project, I have developed my understanding of local storage, API keys, CSS, JS and HTML. 

For future development, I would like to change how the application looks when the user initally opens the page. I would also like to prevent the user from being able to store multiple buttons of the same location (e.g. if Moscow is searched for twice, the button should not replicate.)

## Installation

To work on this code copy this SSH key: git@github.com:chelsea32568/Weather-App.git and paste into your desired folder using Git Bash. Then use git pull to pull the file into your local repository. Make necessary changes and then add changes into the git repository by using git add -A, git commit -m "", git push.

## Usage

After opening the HTML file the 'Weather Application appears'

![Image colour indicating the time. Grey shows time has passed, red shows the present time and green shows the future time.](./assets/img/intialPage.JPG)

When a user has searched for a location, they are presented with the current and future information. 

!['Wake Up' message saved to local storage on the application'](./assets/img/local.JPG)

Their searches are saved to local storage and can be clicked to present the current and future data again.
